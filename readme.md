# Music Insights: A Data-Driven Music Analysis Application

## Description

**Music Insights** is a Flask-based web application designed to help music production companies and enthusiasts analyze music data to identify trends, popular genres, and features that maximize sales. The application leverages the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset) from Hugging Face to provide interactive visualizations and actionable insights.

### Key Features
- **Genre Popularity Analysis**: Identify the most popular music genres based on track popularity.
- **Feature Correlation**: Explore correlations between music features (e.g., danceability, energy) and popularity.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize data with dynamic and interactive Plotly charts.
- **Caching**: Improve performance with Flask-Caching for faster data retrieval.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Gain insights into explicit content, track duration, tempo, and more.
